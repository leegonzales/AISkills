- Systematic quality improvement

**Why Keep Original Files Intact:**
- Trusted source with extensive testing
- Well-documented methodology
- Clear research foundation
- No need to modify core content

**README Focus:**
- Iron Law explanation (what is it, why it matters)
- Integration with AISkills workflow
- Three detailed before/after examples
- Practical usage guidelines
- Research citations and references

**Customizations Made:**
- Added comprehensive README.md (not in original)

- No modifications to core SKILL.md

### Attribution

**Original Author:** Jesse Vincent (obra)
**Source Repository:** https://github.com/obra/superpowers
**Specific Path:** skills/writing-skills
**Original License:** MIT
**Integration Date:** 2025-11-16

This meta-skill is part of the obra/superpowers collection, which provides systematic approaches to AI agent development. The AISkills integration maintains full attribution and licensing from the original work.

### Impact

**Improves AISkills Collection:**
- Evidence-based skill development (test first, then document)
- Higher quality through systematic loophole closing
- Better discovery through CSO optimization
- Research-backed persuasion for compliance
- Consistent methodology across all skills

**Addresses Previous Gaps:**
- Skills previously created from intuition, not testing
- Loopholes discovered in production, not before deployment
- Unclear if skills actually improved agent behavior
- Inconsistent documentation quality
- Ad-hoc skill creation process

**Measurable Benefits:**
- Skills address proven failure modes
- Loopholes closed before deployment
- Higher compliance rates (33% → 72% per research)
- Fewer "skill didn't work" issues
- Systematic quality improvement

### Research Foundation

**Persuasion Effectiveness:**
- Meincke et al. (2025) - N=28,000 LLM conversations
- Compliance increased from 33% baseline to 72% with persuasion
- Authority, commitment, scarcity most effective
- Validates parahuman model of LLM behavior

**TDD Principles:**
- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle proven for code
- Same discipline applies to documentation
- No skill without failing test first
- Minimal additions addressing specific failures

### Testing and Validation

**Original Skill Testing:**
- Extensively tested in obra/superpowers environment
- Multiple skill development cycles validated methodology
- Proven effective for discipline-enforcing skills
- Research-backed persuasion principles

**AISkills Integration Testing:**
- Files copied intact from trusted source
- Structure validated against INTEGRATION_RUNBOOK
- README comprehensiveness verified
- Attribution and licensing confirmed

**No Peer Review Required:**
- Fork from trusted, tested external source
- Original author (obra) is recognized AI agent expert
- Methodology already proven in production use
- Integration focuses on documentation, not new content

### Next Steps (Future Versions)

**Potential Enhancements:**
- Additional AISkills-specific examples
- Integration with SkillPackager workflow
- Cross-references to other AISkills meta-skills
- Automated testing templates for skill creators

**Contributions:**
- Core methodology improvements should go to obra/superpowers
- AISkills-specific integration improvements here
- Community examples and case studies welcome

**Complements:**
- SKILL-8: Gemini Peer Review (peer validation methodology)
- SKILL-9: Codex Peer Review (code quality validation)
- SKILL-12: Skill Packager (deployment process)
