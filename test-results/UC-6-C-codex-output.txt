Question: Explain the SelectParents genetic algorithm selection code

Codex Response:
=================

- **Rank Selection**: Order the population by fitness and assign probabilities based on rank rather than absolute fitness, e.g., best individual gets rank 1, next rank 2, etc.; sampling is then performed using these probabilities so even mediocre individuals retain a non-zero chance, helping preserve diversity.

- **Selection Pressure**: The parameter scales how sharply probability drops with lower ranks; values >1 (or > base used) amplify differences so top ranks dominate, while values near 1 flatten the distribution, allowing broader participation.

- **Deterministic Choice**: The code computes rank-based probabilities but finally just picks the top `numParents`; this effectively ignores the stochastic sampling step and simply performs truncation selection, perhaps for simplicity or to guarantee the best performers reproduce, yet it makes the probability calculation redundant.

- **Trade-offs**: Deterministic truncation is fast and guarantees elite parents, but it can reduce genetic diversity, risk premature convergence, and undermine the intention behind computing rank probabilities; classic rank selection would instead sample probabilistically to balance exploitation and exploration.

- **Improvements**: Either (1) remove the unused probability math and document that truncation is intentional, or (2) actually use the probabilities, e.g., cumulative roulette-wheel or stochastic universal sampling; for even better control, combine elitism (e.g., keep top 1–2) with probabilistic rank selection for the rest, and consider tuning/validating `selectionPressure` to keep diversity high.
