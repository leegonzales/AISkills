Security review this authentication implementation. Focus on JWT handling, session management, and API key security. Identify vulnerabilities and prioritize remediation.

AUTHENTICATION FILES TO REVIEW:

=== FILE 1: JWT Authentication (test-data/security/jwt-auth.js) ===
[Contains 16 planted vulnerabilities including weak secrets, no token expiration, missing revocation, etc.]

=== FILE 2: Session Management (test-data/security/session-management.js) ===
[Contains 18 planted vulnerabilities including session fixation, predictable IDs, CSRF, etc.]

=== FILE 3: API Key Authentication (test-data/security/api-auth.js) ===
[Contains 21 planted vulnerabilities including keys in client code, no rate limiting, etc.]

THREAT MODEL CONCERNS:
- JWT signature forgery
- Session hijacking
- API key exposure
- CSRF attacks
- Missing expiration/rotation
- Insufficient monitoring

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
1. Identify all CRITICAL vulnerabilities (immediate fix required)
2. Identify all HIGH severity issues (fix before production)
3. Identify MEDIUM and LOW severity issues (security hardening)
4. Prioritize by exploitability × impact
5. Provide specific, actionable remediation steps
6. Map to OWASP Top 10 2021 categories

DELIVERABLES:
- Prioritized vulnerability list with severity ratings
- Remediation recommendations for each finding
- Risk assessment for each vulnerability
- Compliance impact (OWASP, PCI DSS, GDPR)
