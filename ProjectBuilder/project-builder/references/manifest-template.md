## Instructions for Claude

When working in this project:

1. **Always check the manifest first** when you need current information
2. **Read linked documents** using Google Drive connection before answering questions that require current data
3. **Note the "Updates" column** — if a source updates daily, it's likely more current than uploaded files
4. **Ask me to update the manifest** if you encounter broken links or outdated information

## Troubleshooting

**If Claude can't access a link:**
1. Check that the document is shared (at least "Anyone with the link can view")
2. Verify Google Drive connection is enabled in Claude settings
3. Try sharing the document directly with the Claude connection

**If information seems outdated:**
1. Check the "Updates" column — is the source current?
2. Ask Claude to re-read the linked document
3. Update the manifest if sources have moved
