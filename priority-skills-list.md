## De-duplication Strategy

**Skip these (already in official anthropics/skills):**
- ❌ docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx (official versions)
- ❌ artifacts-builder (official)
- ❌ mcp-builder (official)
- ❌ webapp-testing (official)
- ❌ skill-creator (official)
- ❌ brand-guidelines (official)
- ❌ canvas-design (official)
- ❌ slack-gif-creator (official)
- ❌ theme-factory (official)

**Skip these (appear in multiple awesome lists - same source):**
- Check canonical GitHub repo only, not duplicate listings

## Evaluation Plan

### Phase 1: obra/superpowers (24 skills) - HIGHEST PRIORITY
**Why:** 6.9k stars, battle-tested, recent updates, comprehensive collection
**Subagents:** Assign 6 skills per agent × 4 agents
**Focus:** Testing, debugging, collaboration workflows complement our collection

### Phase 2: Individual High-Priority (12-15 skills)
**Selection criteria:** Stars > 100, unique capability, active maintenance
**Subagents:** 4-5 skills per agent × 3 agents
**Focus:** Technical depth (D3.js, Playwright, security, scientific)

### Phase 3: ComposioHQ Originals (5-10 skills)
**Selection criteria:** Business/productivity skills we don't have
**Subagents:** 1 agent for quick review
**Focus:** Business utility (ads extractor, lead research, etc.)

### Phase 4: Official anthropics/skills (select 5-8)
**Selection criteria:** Creative/unique skills not duplicated elsewhere
**Subagents:** 1 agent for quick review
**Focus:** Algorithmic art, canvas design, GIF creator (creative domain)
