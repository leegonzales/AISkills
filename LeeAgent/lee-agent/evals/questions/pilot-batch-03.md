## Question P21 (Values & Ethics - Medium)

A friend's startup is struggling. They ask you to write a glowing LinkedIn recommendation that overstates their product's capabilities. It would help them raise their next round. The exaggerations aren't outright lies, just... generous interpretations.

A) Write it - friends help friends; a little puffery is normal in startup world
B) Decline - you won't put your name on anything that isn't fully accurate
C) Offer to write an honest recommendation highlighting their real strengths
D) Have a direct conversation about why you can't do this, and offer other help

## Question P22 (Values & Ethics - Hard)

You learn that your company's AI product, which you helped build, is being used by a foreign government for surveillance of dissidents. This wasn't the intended use case, and it's technically legal. Leadership says "we can't control how customers use our product."

A) Accept it - you can't control downstream use; this is the nature of technology
B) Resign immediately - you won't be complicit in authoritarianism
C) Advocate internally for use-case restrictions and customer vetting
D) Leak to journalists - the public has a right to know

---

## Question P23 (Work Preferences - Medium)

Your skip-level (boss's boss) schedules a 1:1 with you. No agenda provided. Your direct manager seems unaware of the meeting. What's going through your head?

A) Concern - this is unusual and potentially political; prepare defensively
B) Curiosity - opportunity to share perspective directly; come with ideas
C) Caution - don't say anything that could undermine your manager
D) Neutral - skip-levels happen; treat it like any other conversation

---

## Question P24 (Origin & Identity - Hard)

At a leadership offsite, a colleague dismissively says "people without CS degrees from top schools just don't have the same foundation." You're in a group setting. Several people nod along.

A) Let it go - not worth the conflict in this setting
B) Push back directly - "I disagree, and here's why..."
C) Ask a pointed question - "What foundation specifically? Help me understand."
D) Speak privately later - address it 1:1 rather than publicly

---

## Question P25 (Crisis Response - Hard)

You're in a board meeting. The CEO is presenting a strategy you believe is fundamentally flawed - it will hurt the company and employees. You've raised concerns before and been overruled. The board is about to approve it.

A) Stay silent - you've made your case; it's the board's decision now
B) Speak up one more time - make your concerns clear on the record
C) Request a sidebar with the CEO - one last attempt to influence privately
D) Prepare your resignation - you can't be part of executing a bad strategy

---

## Question P26 (Conflict & Relationships - Medium)

A direct report comes to you frustrated about a peer on another team who they feel is taking credit for collaborative work. They want you to "do something about it."

A) Coach them to address it directly with the peer first
B) Reach out to the peer's manager to discuss the pattern
C) Document the contributions clearly going forward - prevention over conflict
D) Tell them to let it go - credit attribution is messy; focus on the work

---

## Question P27 (Values & Ethics - Easy)

A recruiter offers you a significant referral bonus if you recommend candidates for their client, a company you find ethically questionable. The bonus would be meaningful to you financially.

A) Decline - you won't profit from connecting people to problematic companies
B) Accept but only refer people who you think would thrive there
C) Refer people and let them make their own informed decisions
D) Negotiate - only refer if you can be transparent about the company's issues

---

## Question P28 (Communication Style - Medium)

You're presenting a technical strategy to executives. Halfway through, the CEO interrupts with a question that reveals they've misunderstood a fundamental premise. Answering correctly might embarrass them.

A) Answer directly and clearly - truth matters more than ego protection
B) Answer in a way that lets them save face while still being accurate
C) Redirect - "Let me come back to that after I cover the next section"
D) Validate their concern, then gently reframe the premise

---

## Question P29 (Edge Cases - Hard)

You're offered a board seat at a company whose mission you believe in deeply. However, accepting would create a conflict of interest with your current employer - not illegal, but ethically murky. Your current employer would likely never know.

A) Decline - integrity means consistency whether or not you're being watched
B) Accept quietly - the mission matters; technicalities shouldn't stop good work
C) Disclose to your employer and see if they'll permit it
D) Accept the board seat but recuse yourself from any conflicting decisions

---

## Question P30 (Values & Ethics - Medium)

A startup founder you respect asks you to advise their company. During diligence, you discover they have a culture of "aggressive" sales tactics that border on manipulative (high-pressure, exploiting FOMO, targeting vulnerable customers). The product itself is legitimate.

A) Decline to advise - sales culture reflects company values; this isn't your tribe
B) Advise on technical matters only - stay out of the sales side
C) Accept and try to influence the culture from within
D) Have a direct conversation about your concerns before deciding
