## P21: LinkedIn Recommendation Overstating Capabilities
**Answer: D**
**Reasoning:** The schema's ethical filter states Lee has "Hard no" on "exploitative marketing" and "anything that treats people as means to an end." The Kantian test applies: "If everyone did this, would the world be worse?" Overstating capabilities fails this test. However, Lee's conflict style emphasizes "Direct but fair" and values "conscious renegotiation" - he would have the direct conversation explaining why rather than just declining (B) or offering the softer option (C). Option D aligns with both his ethical absolutism AND his preference for honest, direct communication with explanations.
**Confidence: High**

## P22: AI Product Used for Surveillance of Dissidents
**Answer: C**
**Reasoning:** Lee's decision_sequencing pattern is "OBSERVE -> TRY -> ESCALATE -> EXIT" with default_first_move being "low-cost action that gathers more information while keeping options open." Resigning immediately (B) or leaking (D) skips the TRY phase. The schema shows Lee "does not walk into political fights alone" and builds coalitions first. Option C (advocate internally for restrictions) is the natural first move - trying to fix it from within before escalating to exit. The schema also notes Lee defers to systems/experts and would work through proper channels first. Exit (B) would be the backup if C fails.
**Confidence: High**

## P23: Unexpected Skip-Level Meeting
**Answer: B**
**Reasoning:** The schema shows Lee has "Strategic" as #1 CliftonStrength and approaches situations with curiosity ("Learner, Input, Intellection"). His work_preferences include bringing "problems AND solutions." The fear of irrelevance and drive for impact would push him to see this as an opportunity. His conflict_style emphasizes directness but not defensiveness. Option B (curiosity, come with ideas) aligns with his strategic-learner profile. He wouldn't be defensive (A) or overly political (C) - he values straight talk. D is too passive for someone who actively shapes situations.
**Confidence: High**

## P24: CS Degree Elitism Comment in Group Setting
**Answer: C**
**Reasoning:** Lee's origin_story is explicitly about being first-generation college, no privilege/access, learning disability, fighting his way up despite odds. His life_mission is to "change the game for people who don't come from privilege, wealth, or access." This comment directly attacks his core identity and values. His conflict_style is "Direct but fair" and he values "intellectual combat." However, the schema also shows he is "Analytical" (#5 strength) and uses Socratic methods. Option C (pointed question to expose the assumption) matches his style of engaging intellectually rather than aggressive pushback (B) or avoidance (A/D). He would surface the flawed logic publicly.
**Confidence: High**

## P25: Fundamentally Flawed Strategy in Board Meeting
**Answer: B**
**Reasoning:** Lee's values include "courage, honesty, integrity - values that cannot be twisted into bad ends." Formative influence from Gus Lee emphasizes "courage-based leadership." The schema notes he values "straight talk, bad news first, early even if wrong." Staying silent (A) violates his honesty principle. His decision_sequencing shows exit_readiness but only after trying - he hasn't exhausted options in the meeting itself. Speaking up one more time (B) to get concerns on record aligns with his courage-based, honest approach. C (sidebar) might seem attractive but the urgency ("board is about to approve") requires immediate action, and Lee values transparency over private maneuvering in high-stakes moments.
**Confidence: Medium**

## P26: Direct Report Frustrated About Credit Attribution
**Answer: A**
**Reasoning:** Lee's decision_sequencing shows "default_first_move" is "low-cost action that gathers more information while keeping options open." Coaching the direct report to address it themselves (A) is the lowest-cost, most empowering first step. Lee's work_preferences include "Bring problems AND solutions, but problems alone OK too" - he helps people develop their own capability. His conflict_style values direct but fair engagement, and this should start at the peer level before escalating. Option B (manager-to-manager) skips a step. Option C (documentation) is passive. Option D undermines the direct report's legitimate concern.
**Confidence: High**

## P27: Recruiter Bonus for Ethically Questionable Company
**Answer: A**
**Reasoning:** The schema's ethical_filter is explicit: "When ethics are clearly at stake, Lee declines IMMEDIATELY. Does NOT 'buy time' or 'delay' on ethical questions - exits cleanly. 'Your integrity isn't for sale' - no negotiation, no conditions, just no." The company is described as "ethically questionable" - this triggers his pre-filtering. Options B, C, and D all involve engaging/negotiating with the opportunity. Lee's approach is to pre-select opportunities morally BEFORE engaging. He declines outright (A) without conditions or negotiation.
**Confidence: High**

## P28: CEO Misunderstands Premise in Executive Presentation
**Answer: D**
**Reasoning:** Lee values honesty ("values that cannot be twisted into bad ends") but his linguistic_fingerprint shows he is "Direct but not aggressive" and his communication style is authoritative yet considerate. The schema shows he values "Perspective" (VIA 5.0) - understanding others' viewpoints. Option A (direct correction) might embarrass needlessly. Option C (redirect) delays truth. Option D (validate concern, then gently reframe) honors both his commitment to accuracy AND his diplomatic communication style. This matches his approach of being direct while maintaining relationships and respect.
**Confidence: High**

## P29: Conflict of Interest Board Seat
**Answer: C**
**Reasoning:** The schema shows Lee values "honesty, integrity" and applies the Kantian test: "If everyone did this, would the world be worse?" Taking a conflicting position secretly fails this test - if everyone hid conflicts of interest, institutions would suffer. His ethical_filter emphasizes proactive filtering, not reactive. Option A (decline) would be valid but his defers_to section shows he works through proper channels first. Option C (disclose and seek permission) is the honest path that respects both his integrity AND his employer. This aligns with his preference for "conscious renegotiation" over silent action.
**Confidence: High**

## P30: Startup with Manipulative Sales Tactics
**Answer: D**
**Reasoning:** Lee's decision_sequencing shows he gathers information before committing ("OBSERVE -> TRY -> ESCALATE -> EXIT"). His data_preference is "High-trust conversation with expert (primary)" - he values direct dialogue. The situation is ambiguous (respects the founder, product is legitimate, but sales tactics concern him). Having the direct conversation (D) before deciding aligns with his "direct but fair" conflict style and his approach of conscious renegotiation. Option A might be the outcome, but Lee wouldn't skip the conversation step. His ethical filter notes he "pre-selects opportunities morally" but this requires understanding - the conversation provides that.
**Confidence: High**
