# Prompt Engineer

Expert prompt engineering by treating AI as an intelligent teammate who needs clear, context-rich communication.

## Features

- **Three Prompt Types**: Do This (tasks), Know How (skills), Learn Domain (expertise)
- **Universal Principles**: Opinionated guidance, examples with reasoning, decision frameworks
- **Anti-Pattern Awareness**: Common mistakes to avoid
- **Output as Files**: Prompts created as reusable markdown files

## Usage

Invoke when creating prompts for:
- System prompts for AI applications
- Instructions for Claude, GPT, or other LLMs
- Skills and capabilities for AI agents
- Review and improvement of existing prompts

## Core Philosophy

### The Genius Intern Framework

Treat AI like a brilliant generalist who can figure things out but needs context about what "good" looks like in your specific situation.

### Async Remote Teammate

Write for AI like you'd write for a smart remote colleague:
- Clear and comprehensive
- Decisively opinionated
- Sufficient context to act independently

## Prompt Types

| Type | Purpose | Structure |
|------|---------|-----------|
| Do This | Single task execution | Purpose → Criteria → Examples → Constraints |
| Know How | Reusable capability | Purpose → When → Examples → Mechanics |
| Learn Domain | Acquire then execute | Foundation → Study → Synthesis → Execute → Validate |

## Key Principles

1. **Be decisively opinionated** - Don't hedge
2. **Show examples with reasoning** - Good AND bad
3. **Provide decision frameworks** - Clear criteria for choices
4. **Address common mistakes** - Proactive prevention
5. **Use visual structure** - Headers, tables, lists

## Anti-Patterns

- Explaining concepts AI already knows
- Apologizing or hedging
- Excessive politeness
- Listing every edge case
- Motivational statements
- Over-specifying process
