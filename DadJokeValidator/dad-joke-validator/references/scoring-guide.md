# Dad Joke Scoring Guide

Detailed criteria for each dimension with scoring examples.

---

## Dimension 1: Pun Quality (0-10)

**What We're Measuring:** Quality and clarity of wordplay

### Score Ranges

**9-10: Exceptional Pun**
- Multiple meanings perfectly exploited
- Sophisticated yet accessible wordplay
- Unexpected but clear connection
- Example: "I used to hate facial hair, but then it grew on me" (grew = literal growth + figurative acceptance)

**7-8: Strong Pun**
- Clear double meaning
- Good wordplay connection
- Recognizable pun structure
- Example: "I wouldn't buy anything with velcro. It's a total rip-off" (rip-off = velcro action + scam)

**5-6: Moderate Pun**
- Pun exists but requires thought
- Wordplay present but not obvious
- Connection works but isn't strong
- Example: "Parallel lines have so much in common" (metaphorical use of geometric concept)

**3-4: Weak Pun**
- Minimal wordplay
- Obscure or forced connection
- Requires explanation
- Example: Puns based on very rare words or specialized knowledge

**0-2: No Real Pun**
- No wordplay detected
- Literal statements
- Humor not based on language
- Example: "I walked to the store and bought milk"

### Pun Types That Score Well

1. **Homophones:** Words that sound alike (two/too, mugged/mug)
2. **Double Meanings:** Single word with multiple interpretations (make up, put down)
3. **Idiom Literalization:** Taking expressions literally (outstanding in field)
4. **Misdirection:** Setup implies one meaning, punchline reveals another

## Dimension 2: Groan Factor (0-10)

**What We're Measuring:** Predictability and groan-inducement (HIGHER IS BETTER)

### Score Ranges

**9-10: Maximum Groan**
- Punchline completely predictable yet unavoidable
- "Of course!" reaction
- Setup makes pun obvious
- Creates actual groan response
- Example: "Why did the bicycle fall over? It was two-tired" (setup telegraphs the pun perfectly)

**7-8: Solid Groan**
- Punchline fairly predictable
- Good setup leading to pun
- Induces smiling groan
- Example: "What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta"

**5-6: Mild Groan**
- Some predictability
- Reaction more smile than groan
- Pun works but doesn't hit hard
- Example: Less obvious puns that require a moment

**3-4: Too Clever**
- Punchline not predictable enough
- More "hmm" than groan
- Requires too much thought
- Example: Puns requiring specialized knowledge

**0-2: No Groan**
- Falls flat
- No reaction
- Confusing rather than groany
- Example: Over-explained jokes that lose impact

### What Creates Groan

- **Obvious Setup:** Question format that telegraphs the answer
- **Simple Punchline:** Short, direct, economical
- **Classic Structure:** Tried-and-true dad joke format
- **Inevitable Pun:** You see it coming but can't stop the groan

## Overall Score Calculation

**Formula:**
```
Overall = (Pun Quality × 2.5) + (Groan Factor × 3) +
          (Wholesomeness × 3) + (Structure × 1.5)
```

**Maximum Score:** 100 points

**Weighting Rationale:**
- **Groan Factor (3x):** Central to dad joke identity
- **Wholesomeness (3x):** Defines the "dad" in dad joke
- **Pun Quality (2.5x):** Essential but not sole factor
- **Structure (1.5x):** Supporting element for delivery

### Score Interpretation

- Room for polish
- Example: "I wouldn't buy anything with velcro. It's a total rip-off" (72/100)
