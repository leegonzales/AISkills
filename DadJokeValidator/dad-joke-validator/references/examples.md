## Example 9: Not Really Dad Joke (Score: 42/100)

**Joke:** "I'm on a whiskey diet. I've lost three days already."

**Analysis:**

## Example 10: Terrible (Score: 35/100)

**Joke:** "What's the difference between a guitar and a fish? You can tune a guitar but you can't tuna fish... unless you go to the store and buy one."

**Analysis:**

- **Pun Quality: 5/10** - "Tuna" homophone exists but...
- **Groan Factor: 3/10** - Confusion, not groan
- **Wholesome: 10/10** - Fish and guitars, fine
- **Structure: 2/10** - Over-explained punchline KILLS it

**Overall: 35/100 - Failed Dad Joke**

**Why Fails:** Classic mistake: over-explaining ruins the pun. Should end at "tuna fish" - the store addition destroys timing.

**Fixed Version:** "What's the difference between a guitar and a fish? You can tune a guitar but you can't tuna fish." (Would score 76/100)
