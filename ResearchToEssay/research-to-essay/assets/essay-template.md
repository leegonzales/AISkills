# [TITLE: Make it Specific and Surprising]

*[Optional subtitle or framing device]*

---

## [Hook Section]

[**Opening move:** Start with counter-intuitive observation, provocative claim, or concrete puzzle. No throat-clearing. No "In this essay I will..." Get to the interesting part immediately.]

[1-3 paragraphs, ~100-150 words]

---

## [Stakes/Context Section]

[**Why this matters:** Establish what's at risk, what current approaches miss, why the reader should care. This is where you earn the reader's attention for the deep dive ahead.]

[2-4 paragraphs, ~150-250 words]

---

## [Main Argument Section 1: {Specific Theme}]

[**Core claim + evidence:** Each major section should advance a distinct sub-claim that builds toward your overall argument. Integrate sources naturally—don't just list them.]

[**Pattern:**
- State sub-claim clearly
- Provide evidence (data, examples, expert testimony)
- Connect to larger argument
- Anticipate and address obvious objections]

[3-5 paragraphs per major section]

### [Optional subsection if needed for complex arguments]

[Subsections only when logical structure requires it—not for arbitrary length breaking.]

---

## [Main Argument Section 2: {Specific Theme}]

[Continue pattern from Section 1. Each section should feel like it *has* to come in this order—if sections could be shuffled without loss, the structure is weak.]

---

## [Tensions/Complications Section]

[**Honest complexity:** Where does the argument get messy? What counter-evidence exists? What tradeoffs are unavoidable? This section builds credibility by showing you're not cherry-picking.]

[2-3 paragraphs, ~150-200 words]

---

## [Implications Section]

[**So what?:** If the argument holds, what follows? What changes? What becomes visible that wasn't before? What new questions emerge?]

[This is NOT a summary. It's extrapolation and consequences.]

[2-4 paragraphs, ~200-300 words]

---

## [Conclusion]

[**Reframe, don't recap:** Circle back to opening hook/question with new context. End with resonance, not summary. Leave the reader with a new lens, not just information.]

[1-2 paragraphs, ~100-150 words]

---

## [Optional: Further Reading / References]

[If including a reference section, organize by theme or source type, not alphabetically. Help the reader know where to go next based on their interests.]

- **For X perspective:** [Source 1], [Source 2]
- **For Y deep-dive:** [Source 3], [Source 4]
- **For Z counter-argument:** [Source 5]
