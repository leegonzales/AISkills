[Paragraph break]

[Continue evidence if needed, but keep paragraphs short—no more than 3 sentences each.]

## LinkedIn-Specific Formatting Notes

### Do:
- Break paragraphs every 2-3 sentences
- Use line breaks for visual breathing room
- Lead with strongest statement
- Keep concrete and specific
- Use occasional bold for **key phrases**
- End with clear CTA or question

### Don't:
- Write walls of text
- Use excessive emoji (1-2 max if any)
- Start with humble-brags ("I'm honored to...")
- Bury the lede
- Use corporate jargon unless subverting it
- Include more than 3 hashtags
- Make it about you when it should be about the idea

### Length Guidelines:
- **Short post:** 50-150 words (quick insight, link to longer piece)
- **Standard post:** 150-300 words (complete thought with evidence)
- **Long post:** 300-500 words (rare, only for truly compelling narrative)

### Engagement Triggers:
- **Questions:** Ask specific, answerable questions
- **Contrarian takes:** Challenge orthodoxy with evidence
- **Frameworks:** Shareable mental models
- **Data surprises:** Counter-intuitive findings
- **Practical tools:** Immediately useful resources
- **Transparent failures:** "What I got wrong" posts
