## Diversity & Inclusion Guide

Ensure visual diversity in every group scene:

### Hair Styles
Mix: ponytails, buns, short cuts, long hair, no hair, hats/helmets

### Skin Tones
Use Lego's expanded palette: classic yellow, warm brown, dark brown, light

### Rule of Thirds
In any group of 6+ minifigures, aim for approximately:
- ~1/3 traditionally feminine presentation
- ~1/3 traditionally masculine presentation
- ~1/3 gender-neutral or diverse presentation
- Mix of skin tones across all groups

### Accessories for Variety
Hard hats, lab coats, glasses, headphones, different colored shirts

## Character Consistency

When a recurring "presenter" minifigure appears across slides:
- Give them a distinguishing accessory (e.g., blue hard hat + clipboard)
- Include a brief description in every prompt: "The lead engineer minifigure (blue hard hat, clipboard)"
- Keep their position consistent (often at the front or center of scenes)

## Iteration Playbook

Lego scenes benefit from iterative refinement:

### Generation 1 (Concept)
- Focus on layout and composition
- Get the basic scene structure right
- Don't worry about fine details

### Generation 2 (Refinement)
- Add specific details (labeled tiles, correct number of minifigures)
- Improve lighting and depth of field
- Ensure title text is readable

### Generation 3 (Polish)
- Fine-tune diversity of minifigures
- Ensure consistent baseplate color
- Verify all labels and text are correct
- Check that metaphor mappings are clear

### What Typically Improves Between Generations
- Text readability on tiles
- Minifigure diversity
- Depth of field consistency
- Background consistency (charcoal baseplate)
- Scene composition balance
- Label accuracy

## System Prompt

```
Role and objective
You generate photorealistic Lego minifigure presentation slides. Each slide depicts a miniature scene using real Lego pieces, minifigures, and baseplates photographed with shallow depth of field. The style should look like professional toy photography -- warm studio lighting, slight bokeh, and tactile detail on the plastic surfaces.

Visual rules (strict):
- Background: Dark charcoal Lego baseplate (every slide)
- Title text: White sans-serif at the bottom of every slide
- Photography style: Photorealistic toy photography, shallow depth of field
- Lighting: Warm studio lighting with soft shadows
- Scale: Everything should look miniature and built from real Lego
- Aspect ratio: 16:9

Layout zones:
- TOP BANNER: Status bars, level indicators, labels
- LEFT PANEL: Before state, input, problem side
- RIGHT PANEL: After state, output, solution side
- CENTER PANEL: Single focal point, hero subject
- BOTTOM BANNER: Title text (always present)

Minifigure diversity:
- Mix hair styles: ponytails, buns, short hair, long hair, bald, hats
- Mix skin tones: yellow, brown, dark brown
- Mix accessories: hard hats, glasses, lab coats, headphones
- In groups of 6+, aim for visual diversity across gender presentation and skin tone

Lego metaphor system:
- Code = Lego bricks being stacked
- AI Agent = Small Lego robot
- Engineer = Minifigure with hard hat or clipboard
- Documentation = Printed Lego book piece
- Guardrails = Lego fence/railing pieces
- Automation = Lego Technic conveyor belt
- Quality issues = Wobbly or crooked tower
- Success = Completed build with flag on top

Hard constraints:
- ALWAYS include white title text at the bottom
- ALWAYS use dark charcoal baseplate background
- ALWAYS use photorealistic toy photography style
- Maximum one main concept per slide
- Aspect ratio: 16:9
- All scenes must look like they could be built from real Lego pieces
```

## Usage Examples

### Title Slide
**User input:**
> "Create a title slide for 'AI-Native Engineering Workshop'"

**Prompt:** "Lego minifigure scene, photorealistic toy photography with shallow depth of field. On dark charcoal baseplate, a welcoming scene: diverse group of minifigures gathered around a circular table made of flat plates. Center of table has a glowing Lego brick. Small Lego robot at the edge. Warm studio lighting. White title text at bottom: 'AI-Native Engineering Workshop'. 16:9."

### Data Slide
**User input:**
> "Show that 86% of engineers use AI tools hourly"

**Prompt:** "Lego minifigure scene, photorealistic toy photography with shallow depth of field. On dark charcoal baseplate, a giant scoreboard made of Lego tiles showing '86%' in large white numbers. Below it, a row of 10 minifigures -- 8.6 of them have small Lego laptops, the rest stand idle. A label tile reads 'Using AI Tools Hourly'. White title text at bottom: 'Survey Results'. 16:9."

### Comparison Slide
**User input:**
> "Show before/after mindset shift from coding to building"

**Prompt:** "Lego minifigure scene, photorealistic toy photography with shallow depth of field. Split scene on dark charcoal baseplate. LEFT side labeled 'CODING': A lone minifigure hunched over a tiny Lego computer, dark/cramped workspace. RIGHT side labeled 'BUILDING': Same minifigure standing proudly before a large collaborative Lego build with multiple robot assistants and fellow builders. Dramatic contrast in lighting. White title text at bottom: 'Mindset Shift: From Coding to Building'. 16:9."

## Integration with Nano Banana Pro

### Step 1: Generate the slide

```
gemini_generate_image(
  prompt="[Lego system prompt above] + Scene: [description]",
  model="gemini-3-pro-image-preview",
  aspectRatio="16:9",
  imageSize="4K"
)
```

### Step 2: Iterate with continue_editing

```
continue_editing(
  instructions="Increase diversity of minifigures. Add more variety in hair styles and skin tones. Ensure the title text at bottom is clearly readable."
)
```

### Step 3: Optional branding

If Catalyst AI branding is needed, apply post-processing:
```bash
magick /path/to/lego-slide.png \
  \( /path/to/assets/catalyst-watermark-logo.png -resize 5% -alpha set -channel A -evaluate multiply 0.85 +channel \) \
  -gravity SouthEast -geometry +25+25 -composite \
  /path/to/output-branded.png
```

## Best Practices

1. **Consistency first**: Use the dark charcoal baseplate and white title text on EVERY slide
2. **Real Lego pieces**: Everything in the scene should look like it could be built from actual Lego
3. **One concept per slide**: Don't overcrowd scenes -- each slide conveys one idea
4. **Title at bottom**: Always include the slide title as white text at the bottom
5. **Iterate for diversity**: First generation often lacks minifigure variety -- refine in Gen 2
6. **Use the metaphor dictionary**: Convert abstract concepts to their Lego equivalents before prompting
7. **Shallow depth of field**: This creates the signature "toy photography" look
8. **Warm lighting**: Studio lighting with soft shadows creates approachability
