## [1.0.0] - 2025-12-20

### Added
- Initial release of Silicon Doppelganger skill
- Phase 1: Extraction Protocol for structured personality interviews
- Phase 2: Persona Schema XML encoding format
- Phase 3: Simulation Engine for multi-persona discussions
- Phase 4: Event Card scenario library (10 pre-built scenarios)

### Features
- 4-step extraction interview covering psychometrics, heuristics, and narrative identity
- XML-based persona encoding that prevents AI drift
- Algorithmic fidelity enforcement in simulations
- Internal monologue requirement for value-aligned responses
- Comprehensive scenario library for business decision testing

### Documentation
- Complete README with workflow documentation
- Detailed extraction protocol with probing questions
- Persona schema specification with field definitions
- Simulation guide with troubleshooting
- Scenario library with custom scenario template

### Design Decisions
- XML chosen over JSON for persona encoding due to better readability in prompts
- Internal monologue required to maintain value consistency
- Rigid schema enforcement prioritized over natural conversation flow
- Interview conducted separately to prevent cross-influence

## [Unreleased]

### Planned for v1.1
- Industry-specific scenario packs (tech startups, consulting, creative agencies)
- Schema comparison tool for team compatibility analysis
- Automated interview assistant mode
- Quantified friction prediction scoring

### Under Consideration
- Integration with actual psychometric assessment APIs
- Long-running simulation state persistence
- Multi-session simulation continuity
- Persona evolution tracking over time
